^cyan;6.3.8^reset;
------------------
* erchius converter now outputs production state to wire node
* sarcophagi mod compatibility modification:
* they now retain object parameters as items, no longer spawn separate cosmetic variants when broken and instead save their 'loot' state as an object parameter.
* decorative variants that are placed will substitute for an appropriate nondecorative variant.
* museum quest no longer requires decorative variant. quest must be abandoned and reacquired.

^cyan;6.3.7^reset;
------------------
* Bone Weapons (Tier 0 to 1) now unlocks for 50, rather than 100, research.
* Fixed immunity to Jungle Slow not being applied by Monster Plate armor and some races.
* Replaced immunity to Clay Slow (not used anywhere) with immunity to Mud Slow (already protects against Clay tiles).
* meleecombo.lua change: weapons with <= 0.5 fireTime (2.0 attack speed) now combo automatically
* bug-as-feature: sufficiently fast weapons can enter a 'frenzy' state with increased attack speed when energy is sufficiently low but not fully drained.
* durasteel dagger now uses meleecombo instead of meleeslash.
* tungsten dagger is now upgradable.
* because tungsten, durasteel and iron daggers are identical at same tier, otherwise, implemented the following:
* tungsten dagger gains +1 crit bonus
* durasteel dagger gains +1 crit chance
* iron dagger gains +1 knockback.
* Now you can get genes out of peaches and pears, not just apples
* added missing bleeding desc info to various weapons including adv alloy and carbon
* racializer doubly verifies the item it's operating on exists, to hopefully prevent an error
* upgrade table: split item selection code from widget selection, selection now triggers lockout. prevents a bug where you could end up spending way more than intended.
* mage_shield.lua code will now refresh shields when reapplied.
* wretchel revised: 100% hp shield. 1% hp drain per second (stopping at 1 hp), 10% reduced (multiplicatively) core stats and incoming healing. effects stack. effects are worsened the longer the target is at 1 hp. consuming wretchel at 1 hp, or spending sufficient time, will immediately kill the player (effectivemult 0 on poison resist followed by math.huge damage as poison)
* added tiny generic projectile
* removed mech power scaling from hidden scaling projectile TTL, this removes them hitting enemies from absurd ranges. also revised speed to be more snappy (360) and, except the mining cannon, they all sync up with the rendered beam.
* improvements to GPS code
* ITDs: Stack Only and Slot Split are now Mutually Exclusive due to an exploit and spaghetti code.
* fixed a typo on radian species text
* adjusted decorative variants of sarcophagi to indicate clearly that they are empty.
* advanced logic gates no longer (incorrectly) change wire state during init, as it is unnecessary and breaks functionality.
* precursor chair adjusted (Ithlian)
* fungus stim now has a price of 100 pixels and an improved tooltip.
* staves/wands now factor their tier into their tooltip base damage. this is purely a tooltip change, and has no effect on actual weapon damage.
* added labgirdiricon.png to /tiles/materials/tilesandgreebles/ because for some reason the game expects to find it there, and it's causing FU server worlds to error.
* fixed an error in fuinputpump
* fix for hidden variant of futimewarp

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.

A: Yes, there is a Discord server. Check the mods page for a link.

Q: Where can I report issues/bugs, contribute, or make suggestions?
