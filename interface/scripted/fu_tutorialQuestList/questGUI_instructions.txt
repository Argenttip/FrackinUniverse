-----     Adding a new questline     -----
------------------------------------------

Add a table into the "lines" array, and fill in the following variables: ( * means optional)
	id				- A string used as the questlines identifier. This is NOT displayed to the user. The display name is added separetly in a different table.
	sublines		- An array holding strings of subline IDs. Sublines hold quests, and by adding a subline to the questline you're adding them to the questline. Added in a separate table.
*	requirements	- An array of questIds the player has to complete before the questline is accessible.
*	moneyRange		- An array holding two values, minimum and maximum pixels awarded to the player for completing all quests in this questline.
*	rewards			- An array holding smaller arrays which hold two values, an items name, and the amount of it the player recieves when completing the questline.
*	secret			- A boolean. If true, the questline will be hidden from the user until they unlock the questline. By default, questlines just use a different image to indicate unavailability.

Example:
{
	"id" : "tutorial",
	"sublines" : ["kevin", "nivek"],
	"requirements" : ["git_gud_2"],
	"moneyRange" : [1, 999],
	"rewards" : [[ "aegisaltore", 5 ], [ "hokucide", 1 ]],
	"secret" : false
}

----------

Add a new variable (named after the questline ID it represents) which holds a table into the "questlines" table inside the "strings" table and fill these variables:
	title			- The title of the questline, displayed in a label to the user
	descriptions	- Description for the questline, displayed in the text box

Example:
"tutorial" : {
	"title" : "Tutorial",
	"description" : "Get to know how things work!"
},

----------

Create a new image file and give it the same name as the id of the questline it represents
Add it the "banners" folder, and set its dimensions (size) to 164x60
Top half of the image should be the 'available' image, and the bottom half is the 'unavailable' state
Add a .frames file for it and yadda-yadda you should know this already
First frame must be named "default", and the other must be named "unavailable"
Check the 'banners' folder for examples.


------------------------------------------
------     Adding a new subline     ------
------------------------------------------

Add a new variable (named after the subline it represents) holding an array into the "sublines" table
The array holds strings of quest IDs it should have under it.
This is how quests are given to a questline.

Example:
"nivek" : [ "git_gud_2", "git_gud_3"]

----------

Add a variable to the "sublines" table inside the "strings" table thats stores the displayed title of the quest line.

Example:
"nivek" : "niveK"

----------

Create a new image file and give it the same name as the id of the subline it represents
Add it to the "givers" folder, and set its dimensions (size) to 164x16
There is a template named "example" in the same folder you can use as a base

------------------------------------------
--------     More Information     --------
------------------------------------------

Quests can be secret too, but instead of being hidden from the player like the questline, they display as "???" without any information.
To tag a quest as secret, simply add   "secret" : true,   to the quests .questtemplate file

----------

Displayed quest rewards and requirements are handled automatically, just add them into the quets .questtemplate file as you would for any toher quest.

------------------------------------------------------------

Example for a full questData.config file with 3 queslines (one hidden), 4 sublines, and 5 quests total:

{
	"current" : { "line" : null, "quest" : null },
	
	"lines" : [
		{ 
			"id" : "tutorial",
			"sublines" : ["kevin", "nivek"],
			"moneyRange" : [1, 999],
			"rewards" : [[ "speedaugment", 1 ], [ "hokucide", 1 ]]
		},
		{
			"id" : "test",
			"sublines" : ["sumfehg"],
			"requirements" : [ "git_gud_2" ]
		},
		{
			"id" : "test2",
			"sublines" : ["sumothafehg"],
			"requirements" : [ "git_gud_4" ],
			"secret" : true
		}
	],
	
	"sublines" : {
		"kevin" :		[ "git_gud" ],
		"nivek" :		[ "git_gud_2", "git_gud_3"],
		
		"sumfehg" :		[ "git_gud_4" ],
		
		"sumothafehg" :	[ "git_gud_5" ]
	},
	
	"strings" : {
		"instructions" : {
			"title" : "Corvex Research Task Terminal",
			"description" : "To select a task, click on its name on the left window, and relevant information will be displayed here.\n\nTasks also come with a color to represent your progress with them: \n^red;red^reset; : unavailable\n^yellow;yellow^reset; : available\n^cyan;cyan^reset; : in progress\n^green;green^reset; : complete.\n\nThere may be different task branches, which you can access by pressing the big image at the top of the window on the left. More become available as you unlock them."
