This guide teaches you to PR a ship template into FU so that players can select it when creating a character.

This also works for external mods adding BYOS presets, for example for non-FU races, though you'll have to create a patch file in step 5 rather than editing the file directly. Make sure you have FrackinUniverse in the 'includes' parameter in your mod's metadata file.


1. Set up Tiled. These guides are useful for this: https://starbounder.org/Modding:Tiled and https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/starbound-and-tiled-getting-started-tiles.131443/

2. Download unpacked FU from the Github and put it in your mods folder.

3. Make a copy of the template BYOS file (_fu_byostemplateship.json) in /frackinship/ships (https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse/tree/master/frackinship/ships), name it in the same style as the pre-existing ships, and design the ship in that file.
- FU's tilesets can be found in its /tilesets folder.
- Make sure your ship has all the basic BYOS components (teleporter, captain's chair, fuel hatch, broken FTL drive, shiplocker, nameplate). The template file comes with these already placed.
- Try to keep your ship's components and other benefits balanced against those already ingame - don't place a Precursor Crucible, for example.
- All ships are designed to be used by all races and cannot be race-restricted, so you should make them usable by all races.
In lore an aquatic race might fill their ship with water, but an Apex player will drown if they choose that ship and so a water-filled ship is unsuitable as a BYOS template.
- BYOS templates are intended to be a jumping-off point for players to expand on and develop their ship further as they see fit.
Make sure everything used within the ship is available to players - don't use unobtainable tiles or objects, or breakable objects like pots and vegetation that the player can't place or replace.
Unsmashable, player-obtainable versions of vanilla breakable objects can be found in the /tilesets/frackinuniverse-custom/fu_proppack_unsmashables.json tileset.
- Items can be added to containers (including the shiplocker) using the treasurePools custom parameter, as in any other dungeon.

4. Make a copy of the template ship's dungeon file (_fu_byostemplateship.dungeon), rename it to the same as your ship file, and edit it accordingly.

5. Give the ship an entry in the /frackinship/configs/ships.config file (https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse/blob/master/frackinship/configs/ships.config) in the same format as the others (this file is sorted, so put it in the right place in the list).

6. (This step isn't necessary for testing, you can do this at the end when you're happy with the ship) Put a preview image of the ship in the /interface/ai/shippreviews folder (https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse/tree/master/interface/ai/shippreviews).
- To match the other preview images, take the screenshot while the ship is flying in-system. It's easy to do this by pausing the game mid-flight and hiding your interface with ALT+Z.
- You can make your character invisible by spawning the item fuinvisiblehat, and hide the ship pet by placing an invisiblenot object somewhere and wiring its output to SAIL's input.
- The "Extra Zoom Levels" mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729791646) helps for screenshotting large ships. If a ship doesn't fit in the 1x zoom of that mod, you'll need to take multiple screenshots (use the game-pausing trick above) and stitch them together in an image editing program, such as paint.net.
- Make sure to run the screenshot through the program PNGGauntlet (https://pnggauntlet.com/) to reduce its file size.

7. PR the ship once you've tested and are happy with it (you can find guides to making Github Pull Requests online if you don't know how).
